			Prof. Salua Hamaza is Assistant Professor in Aerial Robotics &
			Director of the BioMorphic Intelligence Lab at TU Delft,
			Netherlands. She is also Research Fellow at Imperial College
			London, Aerial Robotics Lab. Her research focuses on the
			development of compliant aerial robots capable of interacting
			with objects and the environment for manipulation (primarily),
			and locomotion. Her robotic solutions take inspiration from
			biological systems for flying and interaction tasks, leveraging
			compliance in hardware and software to advance aerial robotsâ€™
			autonomy.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Previously, she was a post-doctoral researcher at the Aerial
			Robotics Laboratory, Imperial College London, United Kingdom.
			She obtained her Ph.D. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from
			Bristol Robotics Laboratory, University of Bristol, in 2019. She
			was visiting researcher at the GRVC at University of Seville,
			Spain, during 2018. Prior to the PhD she was researcher at RAM
			at University of Twente, Netherlands. She received the MSc
			degree from the University of Bologna and TU Delft.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			She is recipient of the 3rd prize Best UK PhD in Robotics, 2019
			edition, and of 2 Best Paper Awards from IEEE Robotics and
			Automation Society. She is Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics
			and Automation Letters, Aerial & Field Robotics. Since 2021, she
			is the TU Delft Aerospace Engineering awardee of a new research
			lab - BioMorphic Intelligence Lab - leading a team of 6 PhD
			students.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Research interests are in two main areas: aerial physical
			interaction and embodied intelligence in aerial robots. Salua is
			interested in the design and morphology of interacting aerial
			robots, and their implications in flight performance and
			autonomy. Types of aerial interaction tasks include:
			manipulation, placement of objects in the environment, dynamic
			grasping, perching, locomotion. Recurring themes are mechanical
			compliance, design of actuators, compliant control theory,
			kinematics and dynamics of multi-DoFs mechanisms for aerial
			robots, bio-inspired morphology & sensing, soft manipulation.
